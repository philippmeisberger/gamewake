Game Wake is a simple to configure virtual alarm clock application. It provides multiple types of alerts and features both a timer and counter mode.

Installation for Linux
----------------------

There are two ways of installing Game Wake: Installation of the stable or latest version. The stable version is distributed through the PM Code Works APT repository and is fully tested but does not contain the latest changes.

### Installation of the stable version

Add PM Code Works repository

* Debian 9:

    `~# echo "deb http://apt.pm-codeworks.de stretch main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pm-codeworks.list`

* Debian 10:

    `~# echo "deb http://apt.pm-codeworks.de buster main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pm-codeworks.list`

Add PM Code Works key

Install the package
